A coworker was sharing some of his faith-related questions the other day and mentioned that he had been discussing them with a mutual friend. Our friend apparently stated that all sin is equally bad, to which my coworker responded with disbelief. Some sins, he said, like murder, are absolutely worse than others.

Does he have a point?

I think so.

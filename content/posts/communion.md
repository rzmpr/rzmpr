Eating and drinking are central to primitive and modern fellowship. There is one meal that we esteem most highly: the Lord's Supper. It has become a formalized and ritualistic affair — so lacking in physical sustinence that it is more gesture than literal meal. When partaking of the Supper, members of the Church mirror Jesus' actions in Mark 14:22-26 with emblems of bread and drink while meditating on some aspect of the crucifixion. 

1. The bread is the Body of Christ
1. The cup (of wine or juice) is the Blood of Christ
1. A prayer of blessing is said over each before consumption
	
There are many parallels between this "rite" and the old Passover. One major divergence is the lack of proper instruction defining when and how the Supper should be observed, which has resulted in wildly varied doctrines. Where some traditions hold to monthly schedules, Churches of Christ almost uniformly require weekly observance strictly on Sunday (as the Lord's Day). Yet there are variables even within this doctrine: should the Supper be offered more than once on Sunday? Should an evening service be held in which morning absentees get the chance to partake? Should the rest of the congregation abstain from a second round? How should the emblems be distributed? Should the bread be broken by individual participants or an officiant? Should all drink from one cup?

Point: the Biblically recorded accounts of the Lord's Supper lack sufficient specificity to be entirely prescriptive. What is prescriptive? Our Lord's instruction to "do this in remembrance of" him. Add to this Paul's admonishment to self examination for worthy participation in the body and blood. Almost everything else about the Lord's Supper is circumstantial.

| Issue | Teaching | Authority |
|----|----|----|
| Frequency | Offered every Sunday, exclusive | Circumstance|
| Participation | One observance per week, when offered | Tradition |
| Occasion | During formal assembly | Circumstance |
| Elements | Bread, fruit of the vine | Example |
| Form | Unleavened bread, unfermented grape juice | Circumstance |
| Method | Distributed elements consumed after a blessing | Example |
| Purpose | To remember Christ and partake in his body and blood | Instruction |

## Frequency, Participation, and Occasion
This is the least discussed aspect of the Lord's Supper in the Bible, but the Church of Christ doctrine in this regard is the most entrenched. Condemnation of others from Church of Christ preachers and teachers, in the context of the Lord's Supper, is likely to be over some discrepancy in the occasion or frequency of the offending party's implementation. Some congregationalist churches offer the Lord's Supper monthly, and many denominations offer it too often or too infrequently for Church of Christ tastes.

The Church of Christ is mostly uniform in offering the Lord's Supper every week on Sunday — and only Sunday — during corporate assembly as an act of worship. Their argument for this stems from a particular interpretational approach to scripture colloquially known as [CENI](../authority). This _hermenutic,_ in short, states that nothing is permissible unless authorized in the Bible by command, approved Apostolic example, or necessary inference. The Lord's Supper, therefore, is practiced in the Churches of Christ in a manner that seems to them most consistent with the Bible record within their frame of interpretation.

> Both [in I Corinthians 11] and when the Lord’s Supper was instituted, the frequency of the partaking is not mentioned. It only says as often as it is done. It is from Acts 20:7 that we learn that the disciples partook of the Lord’s Supper on the first day of the week. This then is the frequency it is to be partaken -- every first day of the week. The duration is given in I Corinthians 11. This memorial is to be done until the Lord returns.[^1]

This statement is a succinct encapsulation of the Church of Christ position, and it necessarily excludes the assumptions the author makes in order to affirm a doctrine without expressing the level of estimation involved. Acts 20:7 reads:

> On the first day of the week, when the ==disciples were gathered together to break bread==, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day; and continued his speech until midnight. **— Acts 20:7, WEB**

Note that the author of the Church of Christ statement writes "Lord's Supper" where "break bread" is written in Acts 20. He assumes they are interchangable in this context, and defends his assumption elsewhere:

> I Corinthians 11:22 and 34 tell us that the Lord's Supper was not a common meal to be eaten individually in people's homes. Compare this to Acts 2:42, "And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers." Here the breaking of bread is listed among items of worship: Learning God's word, assembling, and praying. In Acts 2:42, the phrase refers to the Lord's Supper.
>
>Now, concerning Acts 20:7, what do we learn from the context? First, it was done on Sundays when the disciples came together for the purpose of breaking bread. Whatever the meal was, it was something that only occurred once a week. If it was a common meal, you would not expect it to be restricted to a single day of the week. After all, in Acts 2:46 we see that sharing meals was sometimes a daily event. But this particular meal made Sundays an important day of the week. Second, it required the disciples to come together to partake of this breaking of bread. This calls to mind Paul's discussion of the Lord's Supper in I Corinthians 11. Notice how often the phrase "come together" appears in this discussion (I Corinthians 11:17, 18, 20, 33). Third, while some early churches meet in a disciple's home, the group in Troas meet in an upper room (Acts 20:8). Once again, we see that this is a special gathering, separate from the home.
>
>The conclusion can only be that Acts 20:7 is referring to the partaking of the Lord's Supper.[^2]

In the CENI hermenutic, this is an application of _necessary inference_. The author uses a certain logical flow to arrive at what he might call an inescapable conclusion, that is, "that Acts 20:7 is referring to the partaking of the Lord's Supper." Invalidating a necessary inference only requires that an alternative be found, and examining the author's logic quickly shows there are several alternative inferences that lead to a different conclusion.

- Nothing makes Sunday restrictive
- Coming together for a meal is not unique to the Lord's Supper
- The location, outside of a home, does not necessitate a special occasion

Since it is possible that the disciples shared a meal while gathered in a communal place on Sunday (as other disciples had done and as a straight reading of this passage conveys), ==there is nothing that logically necessitates interpreting Acts 20:7 to be the singular authorized pattern for observing the Lord's Supper==.

Of course, gathering on Sunday to partake of the Lord's Supper is perfectly valid as it does not violate or disregard any information we actually do have concerning its observance. What is likely very wrong, however, is insisting on this point of view as a matter of doctrine and condemning any deviant practice. There is simply no emphasis on when and where the Lord's Supper should be observed in the Bible. 

## Elements and Form

Bread recipies and juice brands vary widely from church to church, but nearly all Churches of Christ serve some form of unleavened, unsalted host and unmixed grape juice. The bread is most diverse, ranging from homemade flatbread to storebought cracker to processed wafers. The juice is almost never white. Again, there is no discussion in the Bible relating to the composition of either element, but many Churches of Christ would argue that leavened bread and wine are sacrilegious.

While it is true that Jesus' institution of the Lord's Supper occurred during Passover and certainly constituted of unleavened bread, we are under no obligation to observe Passover nor are the Corinthians instructed to hold to Old Law restrictions on leavening agents. It is a worthy tradition to mimic the actions of Jesus by using unleavened bread as he did, unless and until the tradition becomes doctrine and is used to condemn non-conformants. Concerning wine, while there is reason to believe this was not a fermented beverage, we are similarly free of Old Law requirements and not restricted by any further instruction.

Form is also quite variable. Sometimes the elements are placed in trays containing individual portions to be passed around. The bread in this implementation can be presented in large pieces for members to break off their own portion, or the tray may contain bite-size wafers. Pre-packaged elements usually come in a container sealed on both ends, one side containing juice or wine and the other a processed bread portion. There is a sub-movement within the Churches of Christ whose congregants drink from one shared cup.

I was raised in a tradition that served the congregation with multiple trays holding large crackers and dozens of small juice-filled cups. This is certainly not a form observed in the New Testament, but, like every other variant, it does not violate any revealed instruction.

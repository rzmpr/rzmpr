# The Lord's Supper

Eating and drinking are central to primitive and modern fellowship. There is one meal that we esteem most highly: the Lord's Supper. It has become a formalized and ritualistic affair â€” so lacking in physical sustinence that it is more gesture than literal meal. When partaking of the Supper, members of the Church mirror Jesus' actions in Mark 14:22-26 with emblems of bread and drink while meditating on some aspect of the crucifixion. 

1. The bread is the Body of Christ
1. The cup (of wine or juice) is the Blood of Christ
1. A prayer of blessing is said over each as they are distributed
	
There are many parallels between this "rite" and the old Passover. One major divergence is the lack of proper instruction defining when and how the Supper should be observed, which has resulted in wildly varied doctrines. Where some traditions hold to monthly schedules, Churches of Christ almost uniformly require weekly observance strictly on Sunday (as the Lord's Day). Yet there are variables even within this doctrine: should the Supper be offered more than once on Sunday? Should an evening service be held in which morning absentees get the chance to partake? Should the rest of the congregation abstain from a second round? How should the emblems be distributed? Should the bread be broken by individual participants or an officiant? Should all drink from one cup?

Point: the Biblically recorded accounts of the Lord's Supper lack sufficient specificity to be entirely prescriptive. What is prescriptive? Our Lord's instruction to "do this in remembrance of" him. Add to this Paul's admonishment to self examination for worthy participation in the body and blood. Almost everything else about the Lord's Supper is circumstantial.

            <description>&lt;p&gt;My church is beginning the process of searching out men to serve as new elders alongside the eldership we&amp;rsquo;ve had for the past &lt;sup&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; years. This congregation has not had to consider this issue to my knowledge for at least that long, so the sermon today started a series of studies that will refresh us on why we need an eldership and who we should look for to fill that role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My church is beginning the process of searching out men to serve as new elders alongside the eldership we&rsquo;ve had for the past <sup><strong>11</strong></sup> years. This congregation has not had to consider this issue to my knowledge for at least that long, so the sermon today started a series of studies that will refresh us on why we need an eldership and who we should look for to fill that role.</p>
<p>I attended one church regularly in the past that did not have elders; they were goverened by a &ldquo;men&rsquo;s meeting&rdquo; that was more or less democratic. This isn&rsquo;t a biblical concept, but it&rsquo;s usually justified by the necessity to have <em>some</em> leadership when a congregation lacks willing, able, and/or qualified men to take the elder&rsquo;s office. That church never attempted to appoint elders while I was there, and, actually, I think I&rsquo;ve managed not to be present when any of my childhood congregations went through the process. (Maybe once, but not that I can confidently say was the appointment of a new elder.)</p>
<p>There was, however, a time when I really resented the structure and perception of elders in the Church of Christ and I definitely came to the idea that we had the whole concept wrong. There was plently of emotional motivation behind that whole study though, so I won&rsquo;t rely on it now. Instead, what I&rsquo;m going to do is record my <strong>impressions/off-the-cuff thoughts</strong> about eldership in the next section — without any initial study aside from today&rsquo;s sermon — so that I may have a better chance of identifying biases when I study and fill out the subsequent sections of this post. Hope that makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>
<p>Everything we know about an early-church eldership is from Paul and it&rsquo;s mostly indirect. He doesn&rsquo;t give much instruction directly to elders or tell them how to do their job or even what their job is in real detail. Where elders are required is ambiguous as well; does &ldquo;every city&rdquo; then translate to &ldquo;every church&rdquo; today? I know the argument for a plurality of elders is based on the reading that elders are always mentioned in the plural and never singularly in the context of a church office, but the lack of postive affirmation on this point can&rsquo;t be ignored. Elders are always spiritual leaders in the Bible, never <em>executive</em> or <em>business</em> leaders. The only possible exception I can think of to this is the implied distribution of aid to Judea&hellip; but then it&rsquo;s not clear whose elders received the collection.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s elders seem mostly executive. They run the church, manage a staff of deacons, make financial decisions, and deal with the personal problems of members throughout the congregation. They also set the tone for doctrine and teaching in the church. They hire the preacher, are usually listed on the church&rsquo;s charter or articles of incorporation, and generally take on accountability for the church&rsquo;s property and resources. They serve more as directors of an institution than spiritual shepherds.</p>
<p>The executiveness or directorly appearance of the modern eldership is, to me, largely due to the institutional nature of today&rsquo;s congregations. They are often incorporated, own property and do business as a legal entity. Naturally there arises a structure of people to run the entity — deacons as treasurers, grounds keepers, programers, and ministry leaders, elders as the final decision makers and approval stampers. I&rsquo;m not trying to downplay the very heavy burden of the church&rsquo;s people themselves, either. Elders are also counselors and comforters, they visit members in need, bring those needs to the attentions of the congregation, and sometimes divert resources to relieve them. Let&rsquo;s not forget that they serve as gatekeepers of a sort too, and choose when it&rsquo;s appropriate to remove members from the church.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m not going to clean this section up all that much, if it&rsquo;s wrong it&rsquo;s wrong&hellip; hopefully this post will conclude with a better informed view after much study and prayer.)</p>
<h2 id="the-study-begins">The study begins</h2>
<p>A good place to start is with a prayer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Father God, please guide me in this study and help me to put past feelings behind so that they won&rsquo;t twist my understanding now. Give me wisdom and a godly understanding of the eldership so that I may not hinder this church in the pursuit of good leadership. In Jesus&rsquo; name I pray, amen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Review the following passages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><sup><strong>17</strong></sup> From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to himself the elders of the assembly. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When they had come to him, he said to them, “You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> how I didn’t shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there; <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But these things don’t count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God.</p>
<p><sup><strong>25</strong></sup> “Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching God’s Kingdom, will see my face no more. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore I testify to you today that I am clean from the blood of all men, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> for I didn’t shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Take heed, therefore, to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I didn’t cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Now, brothers, I entrust you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I coveted no one’s silver, gold, or clothing. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”</p>
<p><sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They all wept freely, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. Then they accompanied him to the ship. <strong>— Acts 20:17-38</strong></p></blockquote>

            <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Christian, and I want to follow Jesus. I was raised in the church but left, did many sinful things along the way, and within the past couple of years have found my way back out of a sense of guilt. Now I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stay for better reasons — primarily that I love God for what he offers and want to be a productive member of his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m a Christian, and I want to follow Jesus. I was raised in the church but left, did many sinful things along the way, and within the past couple of years have found my way back out of a sense of guilt. Now I&rsquo;m trying to stay for better reasons — primarily that I love God for what he offers and want to be a productive member of his kingdom.</p>
<h1 id="what-im-starting-with">What I&rsquo;m starting with</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>God created and set our universe in motion; he maintains our physical existance and provides spiritual redemption by his son, Jesus — God made man.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that&rsquo;s the best I can do at writing a one-line statement of faith. Growing up in the Church of Christ (acappella, non-institutional branch if you&rsquo;re wondering) gave me a very stark perspective of right and wrong: either you&rsquo;re completely cleansed, or you&rsquo;ve committed one unconfessed sin and are lost. Somehow I still ended up justifying many lawless things I did (or suppressing my conscience to enable them), so as a disciplinary tool damnation wasn&rsquo;t effective at keeping me out of trouble, but it did come back to haunt me in later years. Grown up and out of the CoC, I deconstructed enough to leave all but the fear of the Lord behind.</p>
<p>Eventually, something that sparked a feeling of guilt brought the fear to the forefront of my mind. It took over and I suffered through a year and more both righting past wrongs and trying to be &ldquo;righteous&rdquo;. Guilt-motivation brought me to real depression — I lost weight, my heart never seemed to stop racing while I was awake, I couldn&rsquo;t easily have fun or enjoy entertainment, etc. I realize, intellectually, that a lot of my anxiety was unnecessary because it was more about getting worldly things right than it was about relying on God&rsquo;s promised grace and forgiveness.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God is faithful to forgive. Forgetting about the past, I focus on what is to come.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much better to be anxious to please God in what I am doing now than trying to wipe the slate clean myself. That&rsquo;s something only God can do anyway, and there&rsquo;s nothing works-related that I can do to add to my salvation. So, now, a little older and a bit worse for wear, I want to return to regular Biblical studies and share some of what I find to be good and vent now and then about what gets on my nerves.</p>
<h1 id="what-i-think-about-the-hard-questions">What I think about the hard questions</h1>
<p>These are just my thoughts: some are more well informed than others and I&rsquo;ve been wrong enough times to know I can be wrong now too. <em>I&rsquo;m also a bit rusty (the hiatus I mentioned above).</em></p>
<h2 id="freewill-or-predestination">Freewill or Predestination?</h2>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ve come around to my mom&rsquo;s take on this one. In so many words: &ldquo;I think it is true that God will accomplish his will within the framework of human freewill. &hellip; None of us have the choice not to be accountable to God, but we all have the choice whether to serve him willingly with our lives, bowing the knee out of true devotion and faithfulness, or to serve him like Pharaoh did, and be forced to our knee against our will in the end. God hardens people’s hearts by repeatedly confronting them with the truth they do not want.&rdquo;</p>

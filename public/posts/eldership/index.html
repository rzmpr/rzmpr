        <p>My church is beginning the process of searching out men to serve as new elders alongside the eldership we&rsquo;ve had for the past 11 years. This congregation has not had to consider this issue to my knowledge for at least that long, so the sermon today started a series of studies that will refresh us on why we need an eldership and who we should look for to fill that role.</p>
<p>I attended one church regularly in the past that did not have elders; they were goverened by a &ldquo;men&rsquo;s meeting&rdquo; that was more or less democratic. This isn&rsquo;t a biblical concept, but it&rsquo;s usually justified by the necessity to have <em>some</em> leadership when a congregation lacks willing, able, and/or qualified men to take the elder&rsquo;s office. That church never attempted to appoint elders while I was there, and, actually, I think I&rsquo;ve managed not to be present when any of my childhood congregations went through the process. (Maybe once, but not that I can confidently say was the appointment of a new elder.)</p>
<p>There was, however, a time when I really resented the structure and perception of elders in the Church of Christ and I definitely came to the idea that we had the whole concept wrong. There was plently of emotional motivation behind that whole study though, so I won&rsquo;t rely on it now. Instead, what I&rsquo;m going to do is record my <strong>impressions/off-the-cuff thoughts</strong> about eldership in the next section — without any initial study aside from today&rsquo;s sermon — so that I may have a better chance of identifying biases when I study and fill out the subsequent sections of this post. Hope that makes sense.</p>
<h2 id="impressions">Impressions</h2>
<p>Everything we know about an early-church eldership is from Paul and it&rsquo;s mostly indirect. He doesn&rsquo;t give much instruction directly to elders or tell them how to do their job or even what their job is in real detail. Where elders are required is ambiguous as well; does &ldquo;every city&rdquo; then translate to &ldquo;every church&rdquo; today? I know the argument for a plurality of elders is based on the reading that elders are always mentioned in the plural and never singularly in the context of a church office, but the lack of postive affirmation on this point can&rsquo;t be ignored. Elders are always spiritual leaders in the Bible, never <em>executive</em> or <em>business</em> leaders. The only possible exception I can think of to this is the implied distribution of aid to Judea&hellip; but then it&rsquo;s not clear whose elders received the collection.</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s elders seem mostly executive. They run the church, manage a staff of deacons, make financial decisions, and deal with the personal problems of members throughout the congregation. They also set the tone for doctrine and teaching in the church. They hire the preacher, are usually listed on the church&rsquo;s charter or articles of incorporation, and generally take on accountability for the church&rsquo;s property and resources. They serve more as directors of an institution than spiritual shepherds.</p>
<p>The executiveness or directorly appearance of the modern eldership is, to me, largely due to the institutional nature of today&rsquo;s congregations. They are often incorporated, own property and do business as a legal entity. Naturally there arises a structure of people to run the entity — deacons as treasurers, grounds keepers, programers, and ministry leaders, elders as the final decision makers and approval stampers. I&rsquo;m not trying to downplay the very heavy burden of the church&rsquo;s people themselves, either. Elders are also counselors and comforters, they visit members in need, bring those needs to the attentions of the congregation, and sometimes divert resources to relieve them. Let&rsquo;s not forget that they serve as gatekeepers of a sort too, and choose when it&rsquo;s appropriate to remove members from the church.</p>
<p>(I&rsquo;m not going to clean this section up all that much, if it&rsquo;s wrong it&rsquo;s wrong&hellip; hopefully this post will conclude with a better informed view after much study and prayer.)</p>
<h2 id="the-study-begins">The study begins</h2>
<p>A good place to start is with a prayer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Father God, please guide me in this study and help me to put past feelings behind so that they won&rsquo;t twist my understanding now. Give me wisdom and a godly understanding of the eldership so that I may not hinder this church in the pursuit of good leadership. In Jesus&rsquo; name I pray, amen.</p></blockquote>
<p>The basic passages I&rsquo;ll read:</p>
<pre><code>- 1 Peter 5:1-5
- Acts 20:17-38
- 1 Tim 3:1-7
- Titus 1:5-9
- Hebrews 13:7, 17
- Ephesians 4:11
- Acts 14:21-23
- Acts 11:30
</code></pre>
<h3 id="pauls-farewell-to-the-ephesian-elders">Paul&rsquo;s Farewell to the Ephesian Elders</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><sup><strong>17</strong></sup> From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called to himself the elders of the assembly. <sup><strong>18</strong></sup> When they had come to him, he said to them, “You yourselves know, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you all the time, <sup><strong>19</strong></sup> serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears, and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews; <sup><strong>20</strong></sup> how I didn’t shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house, <sup><strong>21</strong></sup> testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus. <sup><strong>22</strong></sup> Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there; <sup><strong>23</strong></sup> except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me. <sup><strong>24</strong></sup> But these things don’t count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News of the grace of God.</p>
<p><sup><strong>25</strong></sup> “Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about preaching God’s Kingdom, will see my face no more. <sup><strong>26</strong></sup> Therefore I testify to you today that I am clean from the blood of all men, <sup><strong>27</strong></sup> for I didn’t shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. <sup><strong>28</strong></sup> Take heed, therefore, to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the assembly of the Lord and God which he purchased with his own blood. <sup><strong>29</strong></sup> For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock. <sup><strong>30</strong></sup> Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them. <sup><strong>31</strong></sup> Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years I didn’t cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears. <sup><strong>32</strong></sup> Now, brothers, I entrust you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. <sup><strong>33</strong></sup> I coveted no one’s silver, gold, or clothing. <sup><strong>34</strong></sup> You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities, and those who were with me. <sup><strong>35</strong></sup> In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”</p>
<p><sup><strong>36</strong></sup> When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. <sup><strong>37</strong></sup> They all wept freely, and fell on Paul’s neck and kissed him, <sup><strong>38</strong></sup> sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken, that they should see his face no more. Then they accompanied him to the ship. <strong>— Acts 20:17-38</strong></p></blockquote>
<h4 id="takeaway">Takeaway</h4>
<p>Aside from the scene, Paul gives the elders a couple of lines of instruction: <em>&ldquo;Pay attention to and shepherd your flock from the wolves that will come, even from among you, drawing disciples away. Watch &ndash; my example is unceasing &ndash; don&rsquo;t let your guard down and don&rsquo;t give up.</em> Concerning the role of elders, this passage boils down to earnest defense of the word of God and correct understanding of it within the group they have purview over.</p>
<h3 id="peters-exhortation">Peter&rsquo;s Exhortation</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><sup><strong>1</strong></sup> Therefore I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and who will also share in the glory that will be revealed: <sup><strong>2</strong></sup> shepherd the flock of God which is among you, exercising the oversight, not under compulsion, but voluntarily; not for dishonest gain, but willingly; <sup><strong>3</strong></sup> not as lording it over those entrusted to you, but making yourselves examples to the flock. <sup><strong>4</strong></sup> When the chief Shepherd is revealed, you will receive the crown of glory that doesn’t fade away.</p>
<p><sup><strong>5</strong></sup> Likewise, you younger ones, be subject to the elder. Yes, all of you clothe yourselves with humility and subject yourselves to one another; for “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.” <strong>– 1 Peter 5:1-5</strong></p></blockquote>
<h4 id="takeaway-1">Takeaway</h4>
<p>Adding to Paul&rsquo;s instruction that elders should be vigilant defenders, Peter clarifies that elders must not &ldquo;lord it over&rdquo; (or, as I read it, &ldquo;boss around&rdquo;) their flock. They don&rsquo;t tell us what to do, but they do show us the way and drive out those who are a detriment to good faith.</p>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My church is beginning the process of searching out men to serve as new elders alongside the eldership we&amp;rsquo;ve had for the past 11 years. This congregation has not had to consider this issue to my knowledge for at least that long, so the sermon today started a series of studies that will refresh us on why we need an eldership and who we should look for to fill that role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m a Christian, and I want to follow Jesus. I was raised in the church but left, did many sinful things along the way, and within the past couple of years have found my way back out of a sense of guilt. Now I&amp;rsquo;m trying to stay for better reasons â€” primarily that I love God for what he offers and want to be a productive member of his kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
